# Internationalization (i18n)
This directory contains the internationalization (i18n) files for the project.
Goal is to provide translations for different languages to support a wider audience.

## Contributing
> [!NOTE]
> `en-GB.json` Contains translations for British English, which is considered the default language.

To add or update translations, edit the respective JSON files in this directory.
Each file corresponds to a specific language code (e.g., `no-NB.json` for Norwegian Bokmål).
Make sure to follow the existing structure and format when adding new translations.

An easy way to contribute is to copy the `en-GB.json` file and rename it to the desired language code, then translate the values accordingly.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not change the keys, only the values. Keys are the same across all languages to ensure that the application can correctly map translations.
