> `en-GB.json` Contains translations for British English, which is considered the default language.

To add or update translations, edit the respective JSON files in this directory.
Each file corresponds to a specific language code (e.g., `no-NB.json` for Norwegian Bokmål).
Make sure to follow the existing structure and format when adding new translations.
